Presenting my work done during my PhD - work in progress 

There are two main apps that are working, but needs to be updated - the Homepage app simply some samples of my work,
future reviews of Python algorithsm/ Molecular Dynamics topics as well as paper drafts I will be writing

The second, ScienceBlog, has a blog in eternal progres that gives an overview of the topics and specific points I find
interesting in my own work and in the works of others, and to allow others to criticize my work
